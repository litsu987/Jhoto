# CHANGELOG:
# Now it's pretty easy to add your new filters and overlay effects! (Check the Header of the script for more information.);
# Pok√©mon now will animate properly instead of having their animations off by default!;
# The code is way more readable and flexible!;
# Moved Graphics from Plugins to Graphics folder (Neccessary considering you're recommended to delete the Plugins folder before releasing the game);
# You can save as many pictures as you want now, multiple pictures on the same map will have a (x) indicating the amount of pictures taken in that map;
# Pictures are now saved in a directory called Screenshots, this directory is created automatically once you take your first screenshot
# You cannot move the camera in Snap Edges maps anymore, this is due to bugs tied to the camera movement
# No more events on the way, now all events but the player and their party will be invisible so they don't get in the way of the picture
